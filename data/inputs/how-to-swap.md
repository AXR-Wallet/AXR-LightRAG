A step-by-step guide to navigating the "SWAP" feature on the AXIR wallet.

###### What is Swap?

In cryptocurrency, a swap refers to the exchange of one digital asset for another without the need for an intermediary, such as a centralized exchange. Swaps are typically facilitated through decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or automated market maker (AMM) platforms, which utilize smart contracts to enable peer-to-peer trading directly on blockchain networks.

There are two main types of swaps in cryptocurrency:

- 1 **Token Swaps:** Token swaps involve exchanging one type of cryptocurrency or token for another. This could involve swapping between different cryptocurrencies, such as trading Bitcoin for Ethereum, or swapping between different tokens on the same blockchain network.
- 2 **Asset Swaps:** Asset swaps involve exchanging digital assets for other types of assets, such as fiat currency or commodities. For example, users may swap their cryptocurrency holdings for stablecoins, which are digital assets pegged to the value of fiat currencies, to mitigate volatility or facilitate trading.
