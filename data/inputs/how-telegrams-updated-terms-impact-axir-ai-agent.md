Updated Terms   
Impact AXIR AI Agent
-------------------------------------------------------

AXIR AI Agent &amp; Telegram’s New Terms: Here’s What You Need to Know
----------------------------------------------------------------------

As technology evolves, we’re witnessing a fundamental shift in how humans interact with machines—from static interfaces to dynamic, intelligent agents. Agentic AI is at the forefront of this revolution. These are not just bots or assistants that respond to commands—they are autonomous entities capable of understanding context, making informed decisions, initiating actions, and learning from interactions over time.

What Are Telegram’s New Terms of Service?
-----------------------------------------

At AXIR, we envision a future where accessing the full potential of Web3 doesn’t require learning new tools or understanding complex systems. With AXIR AI Agent, we are building toward a world where a secure, conversational assistant acts as your trusted gateway into crypto, DeFi, and beyond—right from an interface as familiar as Telegram.

Some of the most relevant updates include: - **Clearer Bot Policies:**  Telegram is taking a firmer stance on bot behavior, especially in areas like spam, user consent, and data storage.
- **Data Use &amp; Storage:**  There are stricter expectations on how bots handle personal data, including guidance around GDPR and similar global privacy frameworks.
- **Responsibility &amp; Compliance:**  Developers must now ensure their bots comply not only with Telegram’s terms but also with local laws and digital services regulations.
 
Why Does This Matter for AXIR AI Agent Users?
---------------------------------------------

At AXIR, we envision a future where accessing the full potential of Web3 doesn’t require learning new tools or understanding complex systems. With AXIR AI Agent, we are building toward a world where a secure, conversational assistant acts as your trusted gateway into crypto, DeFi, and beyond—right from an interface as familiar as Telegram.

###### 1. Enhanced User Consent

We’ve always prioritized user consent, and now Telegram is formalizing it. From verifying wallets to executing token swaps, AXIR AI Agent only acts when you instruct it to, and only after confirming your intent.

This aligns perfectly with Telegram’s direction: bots must be explicitly authorized by users before taking action. We’ve also implemented clear prompts and confirmations to ensure you're always in control.

###### 2. Data Privacy &amp; Control

Your wallet data, private keys, and transaction history are never stored or controlled by AXIR AI Agent. Everything happens within secure, encrypted channels.

Telegram’s updated stance on data reinforces our design approach: we do not store sensitive user data, and every interaction is designed with privacy-by-default principles.

###### 3. Platform Responsibility

AXIR AI Agent’s development team is committed to meeting both Telegram's compliance requirements and regional Web3 legal frameworks (like GDPR and MiCA in Europe).

This means we’re continuously auditing how the agent interacts with users, ensuring that we provide clarity, transparency, and control at every step.
