Chapter 06 : What is Ethereum
-----------------------------

###### Understanding

Ethereum
========

in Blockchain Technology
------------------------

 ![](https://axirwallet.com/wp-content/uploads/ETH-1.png)  **Introduction:**  Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that enables the development and deployment of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). Launched in 2015 by Vitali Butlerin and a team of developers, Ethereum has rapidly grown to become one of the leading blockchain platforms, offering a wide range of functionalities beyond simple transactions. ![](https://axirwallet.com/wp-content/uploads/Frame-105.png)What is Ethereum? 
------------------

 At its core, Ethereum is a blockchain-based platform that facilitates peer-to-peer transactions and the execution of smart contracts. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily focuses on peer-to-peer electronic cash transactions, Ethereum aims to provide a decentralized computing platform for developers to build and deploy DApps. Key Features of Ethereum: 
--------------------------

- 1  **Smart Contracts**  Ethereum introduced the concept of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with predefined conditions written in code. These contracts automatically execute when specific conditions are met, without the need for intermediaries.
- 2  **Decentralized Applications (DApps):**  Ethereum enables the development of decentralized applications, which are software applications that run on a decentralized network of computers (nodes). DApps leverage the blockchain's decentralized architecture to provide transparency, security, and immutability.
- 3 **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM):**  The Ethereum Virtual Machine is a runtime environment that executes smart contracts on the Ethereum network. It enables developers to write smart contracts in high-level programming languages such as Solidity and deploy them on the Ethereum blockchain.
- 4 **Ether (ETH):**  Ether is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum platform, used to pay for transaction fees and computational services on the network. Additionally, ETH serves as a store of value and is traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges.
 
Use Cases of Ethereum: 
-----------------------

- 1  **Decentralized Finance (DeFi):**  Ethereum is the foundation of the DeFi ecosystem, enabling a wide range of financial services such as lending, borrowing, trading, and yield farming without the need for traditional financial intermediaries.
- 2 **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs):**  Ethereum has become the leading platform for the creation and trading of NFTs, which are unique digital assets representing ownership of digital art, collectibles, gaming items, and more.
- 3  **Supply Chain Management:**  Ethereum's transparency and immutability make it suitable for supply chain management applications, enabling end-to-end visibility and traceability of goods throughout the supply chain.
- 4  **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs):**  Ethereum facilitates the creation of DAOs, which are organizations governed by smart contracts and run autonomously without centralized control. DAOs enable decentralized decision-making and governance.
 
  **Conclusion:**  In summary, Ethereum is a groundbreaking blockchain platform that goes beyond simple transactions, offering a robust infrastructure for building decentralized applications and executing smart contracts. With its innovative features and wide range of use cases, Ethereum continues to drive innovation and decentralization across various industries. ![](https://axirwallet.com/wp-content/uploads/Frame-53-10.png)Chapter 05 :
