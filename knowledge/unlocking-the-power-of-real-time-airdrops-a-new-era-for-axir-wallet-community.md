Unlocking the Power of Real-Time Airdrops: A New Era for AXIR Wallet Community

### **Point-Based Airdrops - A Step Back from Transparency** 

In this ever-evolving highly competitive Web3 space, the concept of Airdrops has become commonplace. Many new projects try to incentivize users to try their products and/or perform certain tasks in return for airdrops. However, not all airdrops are created equal. While some projects offer their native tokens instantly, many provide users with just “Points”.   
  
The problem with point-based systems lies in their lack of transparency and the potential for exploitation by the projects. Users are often left in the dark about the value of these points, when/if they will be converted into tokens. In some cases, users are not even told the number of tokens they will be receiving let alone their value. This lack of clarity can result in frustration and distrust among participants.   
  
Numerous Restaking Protocols such as [Swell Network](https://www.swellnetwork.io/), [Kelp DAO](https://kelpdao.xyz/), [Claystack](https://claystack.com/) just to name a few, are providing points to its users without disclosing the number of tokens, anticipated value and even the time frame.  
  
In contrast, instant native token airdrops offer users clarity. This system eliminates any uncertainty about when or how they will receive their rewards. This transparency fosters trust and confidence in the project, leading to higher levels of engagement and participation.

At [AXIR Wallet](https://axirwallet.com/), we believe in transparency and fairness in all our airdrop campaigns. That being said, we're committed to implementing real-time continuous airdrops in the near future. By providing users with instant access to their tokens, we aim to set a better standard for transparency and fairness in the Web3 space. Together, we lead the charge toward a more equitable and transparent future for all.
