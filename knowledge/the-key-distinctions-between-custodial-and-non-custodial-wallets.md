The key distinctions between custodial and non-custodial wallets
----------------------------------------------------------------

In the world of cryptocurrency, the choice of wallet plays a pivotal role in managing your digital assets. There are two primary types of crypto wallets: custodial and non-custodial. Each of these wallet types has its unique approach to private key management, offering varying degrees of security and control.

[AXIR wallet](https://axirwallet.com/) is a non-custodial wallet that stands out among its peers. In this article, we'll explore the key distinctions between custodial and non-custodial wallets, with a focus on how AXIR provides users with unparalleled control, security, and privacy.

Understanding Crypto Wallets Before delving into the specifics of Axir Wallet, it's essential to grasp the fundamentals of crypto wallets. All crypto wallets, whether custodial or noncustodial, function based on the use of public and private keys.

Public keys serve as your public addresses, allowing others to interact with your blockchain address. These are visible to everyone and are crucial for receiving payments or conducting transactions.

Private keys, on the other hand, are confidential and linked to your blockchain address. The approach to managing private keys is where custodial and non-custodial wallets diverge significantly.

The Custodial Wallet operate with a third-party service provider responsible for storing and managing your private keys. These providers handle the security of your assets, similar to traditional banks managing your funds.
