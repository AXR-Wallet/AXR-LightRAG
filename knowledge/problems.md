 Are you encountering any difficulties? Here, you can find solutions to common issues. ###### Problems :

### 1. AXIR Wallet Android mobile app "failed to install"

You attempted to install or update the AXIR Wallet mobile app, but the installation was unsuccessful. The likely reason is one of the following: There are three different methods to install the Android AXIR Wallet mobile app: - Via Google PlayStore
- By downloading the APK from our Github repository.

Versions from any testing platforms may be compatible with the APK from Github, but not with the version from Google PlayStore. This means that: - An app downloaded from Google PlayStore can always be updated to a newer version from Google PlayStore.
- An app downloaded from Google PlayStore cannot be updated to a newer version downloaded from either other testing platforms or Github.
- An app from a testing platform can always be updated to a newer version from either the same testing platform or Github.
- An app from a testing platform cannot be updated to a newer version downloaded from Google PlayStore.
- An app from Github can always be updated to a newer version from either another testing platform or Github.
- An app from Github cannot be updated to a newer version downloaded from Google PlayStore.

This setup is mandated by Google for security reasons. To resolve the issue, you have two options: - Always stay within the same app source.
- Uninstall the old app before downloading an update.
