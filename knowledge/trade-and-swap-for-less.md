--------------------

 We take a distinct approach to finding the optimal trade. Each route entails different gas fees to execute the transaction. Swaps identifies the best prices and determines the most gas-efficient liquidity source for each trade. ![](https://axirwallet.com/wp-content/uploads/Group-90-1-1024x788.png)Protection Against Slippage

Significant swaps can experience substantial price fluctuations when there's inadequate liquidity on a specific DEX. AXIR Wallet spreads orders across nearly all DEXs to mitigate the impact of slippage on the final price.
